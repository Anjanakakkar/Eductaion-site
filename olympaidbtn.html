                            <p><strong>Quick Fact:</strong>
                                Scoring top ranks in the INChO can lead you to the IChO (International Chemistry
                                Olympiad). </p>
                            <p>To all the students who enjoy studying Chemistry, here is an olympiad for you. The Indian
                                National Chemistry Olympiad or INChO is an annual competition held among high school
                                students. It is a unique opportunity for every student to gain more knowledge and
                                experience in Chemistry. You will be able to connect with students from all over India
                                and even from around the world (if you qualify for IChO). The Indian National Chemistry
                                Olympiad (INChO) is conducted by HBCSE (Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education). </p>
                            <h2><strong>Road to IChO (Until 2020)</strong></h2>
                            <p>To help you understand further how the Indian National Chemistry Olympiad (INChO) plays
                                an important role for you, here are the different exams that a student needs to
                                clear/qualify for International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO). </p>

                            <p><strong>Stage 1: National Standard Examination in Chemistry (NSEC)</strong></p>
                            <p>Students of Class 11 and Class 12 participate in this examination in the month of
                                November every year. </p>

                            <p><strong>Stage 2: Indian National Chemistry Olympiad (INChO)</strong></p>
                            <p>Students who clear the NSEC (generally top 300 students) appear for the INChO. This exam
                                is organised by HBCSE in 15 centres all across India. Those who clear this examination
                                get a certificate from the Association of Chemistry Teachers (ACT) which is a
                                prestigious achievement in itself. </p>
                            <p><strong>Stage 3: Orientation cum Selection Camp (OCSC) in Chemistry </strong></p>
                            <p>The top 35 students are chosen from the examination results of INChO and they are invited
                                to attend an orientation camp at the HBCSE centre. They have to pass several tests here
                                in the camp. </p>
                            <p><strong>Stage 4: Pre-Departure Training (PDT) Camp for IChO</strong></p>
                            <p>5-6 students are selected and given special training for the international olympiad. </p>
