                            <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that AskIITians Private Limited will
                                not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have
                                an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile
                                network provider, but AskIITians Private Limited cannot take responsibility for the app
                                not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have
                                any of your data allowance left.</p>
                            <p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your
                                terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result,
                                you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the
                                connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app,
                                you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if
                                you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning
                                off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the
                                app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill
                                payer for using the app.</p>
                            <p>Along the same lines, AskIITians Private Limited cannot always take responsibility for
                                the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if
                                it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, AskIITians Private
                                Limited cannot accept responsibility.</p>

                            <p>With respect to AskIITians Private Limited’s responsibility for your use of the app, when
                                you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to
                                ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to
                                provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. AskIITians Private
                                Limited accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a
                                result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>

                            <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android &
                                iOS – the requirements for both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to
                                extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the
                                updates if you want to keep using the app. AskIITians Private Limited does not promise
                                that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the
                                Android & iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to
                                always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop
                                providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of
                                termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights
                                and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app,
                                and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>
